                <div class="descLeftColumn hidden">The UW-Stout Mural was created for a Digital Illustration class during the Spring 2022 semester. The class was split into groups of four to spend one month putting together a concept for mural designs. At the end of the project, each mural was judged by a panel curated by the school, and our design was the one selected out of twenty total designs. The mural was painted by an Art and Graffiti class during the Summer of 2022.</div>
                <div class="descRightColumn hidden">For this project, I came up with the initial idea for the design concept and illustrated most of the digital based assets. This included the Gameboy, phone, TV and game console, laptop and printer. After all our assets were created, we collaborated on a final composition, and I was tasked with tracing over each asset to create a comprehensive art style. The colors were chosen from UW-Stoutâ€™s branding, along with an orange accent that pops in the setting sun. </div>
